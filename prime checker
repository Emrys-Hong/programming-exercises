Design an efficient algorithm to determine if# a positive integer N is a prime number. Your code must be able to process large N values (above half billion) under 20 seconds.

```
    def is_prime(N):
        return N > 1 and all(N % i for i in range(2, int(N**.5), 2)) # check only till the nearest square root of N; skipping all even numbers.
```

question 2
Design an efficient algorithm that determines the number of ways 5 non-negative integers can sum up to N. Your code must be able to handle large N values (150+) under 20 seconds. 

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
