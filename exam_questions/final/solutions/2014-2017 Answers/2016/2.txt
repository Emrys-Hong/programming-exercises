a) 2 sonar sensors are required. The front sensor and the right sensor The front sensor is used to determine whether the eBot has approached close enough to a wall to begin following it. The right sensor is used for the eBot to maintain its distance to the wall. The right sensor and the front sensors are both used to determine when the eBot should stop rotating. This can be done by turning the eBot slightly after it detects no wall on its right, and it will stop turning after the right has read a reading and reads no reading again.

b) The two states can be "wandering" and "following". In the wandering state, the eBot simply moves forward until it detects a boundary to follow. It then proceeds into the following state. In the following state, the eBot keeps the obstacle on its right at the specified distance. The eBot will not exit the following state once a boundary is found, as it will simply circle around the boundary. Two states are required in order to account for the situtation where the eBot is not immediately placed next to an obstacle.
